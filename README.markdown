dotfiles
========

My configuration files.

* `.bashrc` -- Synchronised across OS X, Linux and Solaris machines.
  Machine-specific settings are saved to .bashrc.local, which is included by
  this file.

* `.mplayer/config` -- My old mplayer settings. Used with Debian and Ubuntu.

* `.nanorc` -- No longer used.

* `.screenrc` -- Used with Debian; will probably work in other environments.

* `.vimrc` -- Works with vim (OS X, Linux, Solaris), MacVim and gVim.

* `.XCompose` -- Putting the meta key to good use. Used with Debian and Ubuntu.

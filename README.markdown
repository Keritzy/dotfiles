My configuration files.

* **.bashrc** -- Synchronised across OS X, Linux and Solaris machines.
  Machine-specific settings are saved to .bashrc.local, which is included by
  this file.

* **.irssi/inky.theme** -- My Irssi theme; just a modification of the default theme.

* **.lineak/lineakd.conf** -- Lineak settings, for mapping music keys in Linux.
  (Tested with a Dell Inspiron 9300.)

* **.mplayer/config** -- My old mplayer settings. Used with Debian and Ubuntu.

* **.nanorc** -- No longer used.

* **.screenrc** -- Used with Debian; will probably work in other environments.

* **.vimrc**, **.vim/*** -- Works with vim (OS X, Linux, Solaris), MacVim and gVim.

* **.XCompose** -- Putting the meta key to good use. Used with Debian and Ubuntu.
